# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
import math

class cse:
    def mech(self, radius):
        area = math.pi * radius ** 2
        print(f"Area of circle: {area:.2f}")


r = float(input())

obj = cse()
obj.mech(r)
```

## Output
![438927051-0fb24ed2-e483-4f0c-8114-cdb94b36b0cf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e044e969-4432-47ef-afdb-0b573f44167b)

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.

## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that merges *two dictionaries* and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries dict1 and dict2 with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function merge() that merges the two dictionaries using the ** unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from dict2 will overwrite that from dict1.
3. Call the merge() function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
dict1={'Ten': 10,'Twenty': 20,'Thirty': 30} 
dict2={'Thirty': 30,'Fourty': 40,'Fifty': 50}
 def merge (dict1,dict2): 
res={**dict1 , **dict2}
return res 
dict3=merge(dict1,dict2) 
print(dict3)
```
## Output

## Result
thus,the program has been executed successfully.

# ðŸ”¤ Dictionary-Python Program to Sort a Dictionary by Keys and Values

This Python program demonstrates how to sort a dictionary:
- Alphabetically by keys
- Alphabetically by values

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that sorts a dictionary's:
- Keys in alphabetical order
- Values in alphabetical order



## ðŸ§  Algorithm
```
1.Start the program.
2.Create an empty dictionary and add key-value pairs.
3.Sort the dictionary items by their values using sorted() with a lambda function.
4.Store the sorted result in a variable.
5.Print a message and the sorted key-value pairs.
6.End the program.
```
## ðŸ§ªProgram
```
def dictionairy():  
 key_value ={}   
 key_value[2] = 56      
 key_value[1] = 2
 key_value[5] = 12
 key_value[4] = 24
 key_value[6] = 18     
 key_value[3] = 323
 s=sorted(key_value.items(),key=lambda x:x[1])
 print ("Keys and Values sorted in alphabetical order by the value")
 print(s)
 
def main():
    dictionairy()
           
```
## Sample Output
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f19f2bd9-a6f6-4aa4-a418-0d570459faa2)

## Result
The program successfully sorts the dictionary by its keys and values in alphabetical order and prints both sorted versions along with the original dictionary.

# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
lst=[5, 10, 20]
try:
    print(lst[5])
except:
    print("You're out of list range")

```

## Output

## Result
Thus th program  that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list has been executed successfully.

# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of words in a text file .

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
```
1.Start the program.
2.Define a function create_file(file_path, file_content) that:
   Opens a file at file_path in write mode
    Writes file_content to the file
3.Define another function count_words_in_file(file_path) that:
    Opens the file at file_path in read mode
     Reads the content and splits it into words
     Returns the number of words
4.Call create_file() with desired file path and content to create/write the file.
5.Call count_words_in_file() to get the total word count from the file.
6.End the program.
```
## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def create_file(file_path,file_content):
    with open(file_path,'w')as file:
        file.write(file_content)
def count_words_in_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path,'r')as file:
         content=file.read()
         words=content.split()
         return len(words)
```

## Output
